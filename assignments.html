      <p>
        Below is a list of course assignments I've worked on, including brief
        explanations of my approach and links to the GitHub repositories:
      </p>

      <!-- Assignment 0 -->
      <div class="assignment">
        <h2>Assignment 0: Dummy Assignment</h2>
        <p>
          This dummy assignment involved creating a simple Python script to add
          two numbers and print the sum to the command line. It serves as a
          practice submission for this course.

      <div class="assignment">
        <h2>Assignment 1: Elevator Arrival Times Dataset</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, you as a class will collectively record a dataset
          with elevator arrival times on the ground floor in CDS. Using this
          dataset, you will determine the best location to wait in order to
          minimize the expected walking distance to the next arriving elevator.

        <h2>Assignment 2: K-means Clustering</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment focuses on implementing K-means clustering from
          scratch. You will cluster a given dataset and analyze the results
          based on the initial centroids chosen.

        <h2>Assignment 3: Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to perform
          dimensionality reduction on a dataset, exploring the effect of the
          number of dimensions on the performance of a classifier. The results
          are visualized for comparison and analysis.

        <h2>
          Assignment 4: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine Webpage
        </h2>
        <p>
          Objective: Develop an interactive web application that implements a
          basic search engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The search
          engine processes a user’s query, performs LSA on a document pool, and
          returns the top documents based on cosine similarity.

      <div class="assignment">
        <h2>Assignment 5: K-Nearest Neighbors Kaggle Competition</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, you will implement a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
          model from scratch to predict customer churn for a bank. Your goal is
          to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank based on
          historical data and submit your predictions in a mini Kaggle
          competition.

        <h2>Assignment 6: Linear Regression</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment explores the implementation of linear regression from
          scratch, focusing on understanding the relationship between variables
          and minimizing the mean squared error using gradient descent.

          Regression
        </h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, you’ll extend your previous work from Assignment 6
          to include hypothesis testing and confidence intervals through
          simulations. You’ll enhance your interactive webpage to allow users to
          perform hypothesis tests on the slope or intercept of the regression
          line and generate confidence intervals based on simulations.
