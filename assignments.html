      <p>
        Below is a list of course assignments I've worked on, including brief
        explanations of my approach and links to the GitHub repositories:
      </p>

      <!-- Assignment 0 -->
      <div class="assignment">
        <h2>Assignment 0: Dummy Assignment</h2>
        <p>
          This dummy assignment involved creating a simple Python script to add
          two numbers and print the sum to the command line. It serves as a
          practice submission for this course.

      <div class="assignment">
        <h2>Assignment 1: Elevator Arrival Times Dataset</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, you as a class will collectively record a dataset
          with elevator arrival times on the ground floor in CDS. Using this
          dataset, you will determine the best location to wait in order to
          minimize the expected walking distance to the next arriving elevator.

      <!-- Assignment 2 -->
      <div class="assignment">
        <h2>Assignment 2: K-means Clustering</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment focuses on implementing K-means clustering from
          scratch. You will cluster a given dataset and analyze the results
          based on the initial centroids chosen.

      <div class="assignment">
        <h2>Assignment 3: Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to perform
          dimensionality reduction on a dataset, exploring the effect of the
          number of dimensions on the performance of a classifier. The results
          are visualized for comparison and analysis.
