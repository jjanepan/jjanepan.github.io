      <div class="assignment">
        <h2>Assignment 0: Dummy Assignment</h2>
        <p>
          This dummy assignment involved creating a simple Python script to add
          two numbers and print the sum to the command line. It serves as a
          practice submission for this course.

        <h2>Assignment 1: Elevator Arrival Times Dataset</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, you as a class will collectively record a dataset
          with elevator arrival times on the ground floor in CDS. Using this
          dataset, you will determine the best location to wait in order to
          minimize the expected walking distance to the next arriving elevator.

          Assignment 4: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine Webpage
        </h2>
        <p>
          Objective: Develop an interactive web application that implements a
          basic search engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The search
          engine processes a user’s query, performs LSA on a document pool, and
          returns the top documents based on cosine similarity.

        <h2>Assignment 5: K-Nearest Neighbors Kaggle Competition</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, you will implement a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
          model from scratch to predict customer churn for a bank. Your goal is
          to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank based on
          historical data and submit your predictions in a mini Kaggle
          competition.

        <h2>Assignment 6: Linear Regression</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment explores the implementation of linear regression from
          scratch, focusing on understanding the relationship between variables
          and minimizing the mean squared error using gradient descent.

          In this assignment, you’ll extend your previous work from Assignment 6
          to include hypothesis testing and confidence intervals through
          simulations. You’ll enhance your interactive webpage to allow users to
          perform hypothesis tests on the slope or intercept of the regression
          line and generate confidence intervals based on simulations.

        <h2>Assignment 9: Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>
          Assignment 9 delves into the fundamentals of neural networks by
          constructing a simple neural network model from scratch. The focus of
          this assignment is not only on the implementation but also on
          visualizing the neural network’s learned features, decision
          boundaries, and gradients throughout the training process. This visual
          insight helps understand how neural networks learn and make decisions,
          providing an intuitive grasp of complex machine learning concepts.

        <h2>Assignment 10: Image Retrieval</h2>
        <p>
          Assignment 10 is focused on developing a simplified version of Google
          Image Search. This GUI-based project involves creating an application
          where users can input a text or image query and retrieve the top 5
          relevant images from a database, displaying them along with their
          similarity scores. The interface allows users to search by text,
          image, or a hybrid mode, offering control over the relevance of text
          versus image through adjustable weighting. The project provides a
          practical application of image and text embedding technologies in a
          user-friendly search engine.
